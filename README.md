# Algorithm questions and solutions

# [Ascending Array](https://github.com/ozgurutku/Algorithm/tree/master/ascendingArray)
Program to find successively increasing subarrays in an array.
<br/>
<br/>
Example: [ 1 5 7 3 1 2 5 ]
<br/>
Subarrays;
- [ 1 5 7 ] 
- [ 3 ] 
- [ 1 2 5 ]

# [Intersection Line](https://github.com/ozgurutku/Algorithm/tree/master/intersectionLine)
If there is an intersection between the entered line segments, the program that combines them and obtains a new line segments.
<br/>
<br/>
Example: a:1 b:3, a:2 b:4, a:5 b:8, a:7 b:15, a:-2 b:2 line segments
<br/>
New line segments obtained as a result of the union;
- a:-2 b:4
- a:5 b:15

# [FindNumberShortcut](https://github.com/ozgurutku/Algorithm/tree/master/findNumberShortcut)
The program that finds the entered number in the shortest way for consecutive increasing or decreasing arrays.
<br/>
<br/>
Example: [ 3 4 5 4 3 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 ]
<br/>
The output of the program that finds the number 1 in the array in the shortest way:
<br/>
- find number:1 index:14 found it in 5 moves

# [ClockAngle](https://github.com/ozgurutku/Algorithm/tree/master/clockAngle)
The program to calculate the angle between hour and minute hands.
<br/>
<br/>
Example: Let's find the angle between hour and minute hands at 3:55
<br/>
The output of the program:
<br/>
- Between the hour and minute hands narrow angle: 147.5 degree wide angle: 212.5 degree
